*Figure 1: Global temperature-salinity diagram (`comfort.plot`) 
with isopycnals in $kg~m^{-3}$ (dashed lines, reference pressure 0 dbar, computed as density-anomaly) 
of oxygen observations from the COMFORT database. 
Only quality-controlled (`QC_GOOD`) data are loaded, units are harmonised (`comfort.units`) and
oxygen values that are approximately equal to their co-located absolute salinity are dropped (`flag_salinity_like_oxygen`). 
Duplicate spatio-temporal locations are averaged (`average_duplicate_locations`) and temperature, salinity and oxygen inner-joined. 
Absolute Salinity ($S_A$) and Conservative Temperature ($\Theta$) are derived via TEOS-10 (`comfort.physics`). 
The remaining 40,425,889 data points (out of 67,085,418 oxygen observations in the database) are averaged into hexagonal bins and coloured by oxygen concentration. 
The three visible low-oxygen zones in the plot broadly correspond to known oxygen-depleted areas 
in the Baltic, Black and Arabian Sea [@paulmier2009].*

## Summary
`comfort-db` is a Python library that facilitates working with the COMFORT SQLite database, version 2 [@comfort_dataset2022]. 
The database assembles global oceanographic measurements from ten datasets and contains a total of 458,724,734 in-situ measurements from the years 1772 to 2020.
`comfort-db` enables easy access to the database and provides preprocessing and exploratory analysis utilities. 
Preprocessing supports variable scaling and filtering by space, time and quality. 
Unit conversions are implemented as described in the COMFORT compilation report [@comfort_report2021] 
and can be applied during data loading or separately via a converter object. 
TEOS-10 physical oceanography (`comfort.physics`) is built on the `gsw` library [@mcdougall2011]. 
Gridding is supported and optionally works with bathymetry data (e.g. GEBCO [@gebco2022]) to exclude grid cells on land.
Moreover, the library supports general and field-specific exploratory data analysis through plotting functions, 
an interactive dash app and functions to compute oceanographic profile and water mass statistics. 

`comfort-db` builds on and extends code originally developed for [@jenniges2025], including parts of the gridding,
unit conversion, database and plotting routines.

## Statement of need
Currently, a large preprocessing pipeline is required to work with the COMFORT database. 
Users must perform SQLite queries, interpret quality flags and convert units, which involves computing TEOS-10 variables and averaging temperature and salinity variables to get a unique match for an oxygen observation.  
Depending on the use case, users way also want to interpolate profiles, perform scaling and gridding.
`comfort-db` integrates these tasks into one reproducible Python workflow and thus contributes to sustainable and transparent analyses built on the COMFORT database.
This enables users of the COMFORT dataset, oceanographers without a strong software background and data scientists without a strong oceanographic background, to 
focus on scientific questions rather than repeated, error-prone data preprocessing and wrangling. 

## State of the field
A related library is `argopy` [@argopy2020] that enables data access, manipulation and visualisation of Argo float data. 
However, the COMFORT database differs from Argo not only in file format (SQLite vs. NetCDF), but also in scope and structure: 
It merges ten datasets into a station/profile hierarchy with its own SQLite schema, quality flag conventions and unit definitions and intended conversions.
A simple adapter to `argopy` would not cover this schema- and domain-specific functionality. 
To our knowledge, no existing package offers a comparable reproducible interface to the COMFORT database.

## Software design
The organisation of the `comfort-db` library is driven by usability and the scale of the COMFORT database. Since the database
is distributed as a single multi-gigabyte SQLite file, efficiency and low memory use were key design goals. 
For example, space, time and quality filtering is applied at the SQL level rather than after loading potentially large data tables into memory.
<!-- SQLite does not support polygon-based filtering, e.g. to extract a specific ocean basin. Therefore, `comfort-db` enables -->
<!-- it by first computing a broader bounding box, filtering for it in the database and subsequently filtering the data in-memory to -->
<!-- the exact polygon shape. -->
Computations were vectorised where possible to avoid per-row iteration. For example, `distance_to_coast` builds a KDTree
on radian-converted coastline coordinates, retrieves the five nearest candidate coastline points and computes exact
vectorised haversine distances among them. The `classify_from_grid` function similarly performs a KDTree search, but only
retrieves a single nearest-neighbour, without a subsequent refinement step. 
Both functions approximate great-circle distance with Euclidean distance in radians, which is imprecise near the poles and the 
antimeridian (±180°).
Moreover, gridding can be either applied offline, i.e. all data in memory, or online, i.e. directly in the database.

Quality flag interpretation and unit conversions are centralised in dedicated modules (`comfort.qc`, `comfort.units`) so 
that corrections and settings apply everywhere consistently. 
To cater to a diverse audience, more specialised functionality such as plotting, geospatial analysis, gridding, scaling and the dash app,
is available through optional installs (`plot`, `geo`, `grid`, `scale`, `dash`). Thus, the core package stays lightweight for users who only
need database access and preprocessing.

Observations need to be averaged at certain processing steps. 
The COMFORT database contains multiple station IDs at the same spatio-temporal location since multiple large datasets were 
combined and partly contain duplicate information. Therefore, `average_duplicate_locations` identifies such duplicates 
by latitude, longitude, depth and time, catching cross-source duplicates that station ID alone would miss.
When auxiliary temperature and salinity are added to another parameter table, e.g. for unit conversions, they are first 
averaged by station and depth (`io._read_with_geo`), because a station can have multiple profiles, 
i.e. measurements from different instruments at the same sampling event, and averaging them yields a single representative value for the conversion.

Figure 1 was generated by example 7, which illustrates quality filtering, TEOS-10 conversion and unit harmonisation.
The data were then rendered as a global temperature-salinity diagram coloured by oxygen concentration.

## Research impact statement
The COMFORT dataset provides a large compilation of oceanographic observations, including data from 
established resources such as the World Ocean Database [@boyer2018] and the Global Ocean Data Analysis Project [@olsen2016; @olsen2019].
Accessing, preprocessing and exploring this data can require substantial technical effort and 
`comfort-db` lowers the barrier to exploit this extensive resource to facilitate future analyses and reproducible 
workflows. 

To this point, [@jenniges2025] is the only published study using the COMFORT database and investigated three-dimensional
biogeochemical provinces in the North Atlantic. Future analyses [@jenniges2027] will apply the data to spatio-temporal imputation 
of North Atlantic biogeochemistry at 20-year intervals. The preprocessing of both studies can be closely reproduced
using `comfort-db` (examples 9 and 10, respectively), with minor numerical differences from refinements to the
density conventions since the original analyses.

## AI usage disclosure
Generative AI (Anthropic Claude Code, primarily Claude Sonnet 5) was used under direct supervision of the corresponding author (Y.J.) 
to re-structure the author's own pre-existing analysis scripts into an installable package, 
update accompanying documentation, draft the majority of the tests and 
assist in visualisations and identifying and fixing bugs. 
All code was reviewed by the corresponding author, who implemented the original scientific logic. 
Correctness was assessed via the tests, checks against manually computed
unit conversions (`CONVERSION_REFERENCE` in `test/test_units.py`) and execution of all example scripts.
